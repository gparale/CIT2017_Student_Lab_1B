				During his childhood, he spent most of his time trapped inside the underworld, riding a giant three-headed dog(called a cerberus),chasing away possessed skeletons. That is until a fateful day in 1943, Osaka was bombed, the city above the undergound ruined. However it opened a chasm leading to the underground.

			<p class= "paragraph">
				His first glimpse in the surface world was a dark grim reality of what war is. However, it didn't really affect much about his personality. Still, he rode the cerberus to unknown lands, unbeknownst as to what he will see in this brave new frontier.
